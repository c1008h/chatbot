        Outside of coding, I enjoy lifting weights and exploring new ways to challenge myself physically. Lately, I’ve been diving into video creation, working on my creativity and bringing ideas to life through a new medium. These hobbies help me maintain a balanced life and fuel my passion for continuous learning.
